      <H1>Ummm…to eBay?</H1>
      <P>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Bite my shiny metal ass. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</P>
      <P>A sexy mistake. No! <strong> Don't jump!</strong> <em> OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</em> Your best is an idiot!</P>
      <H2>I just told you! You've killed me!</H2>
      <P>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Also Zoidberg. I never loved you. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</P>
      <ol>
      <li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li><li>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</li><li>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
      </ol>

      <H3>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</H3>
      <P>No! Don't jump! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Your best is an idiot! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</P>
      <UL>
      <li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li><li>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</li><li>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</li>
      </UL>

      <P>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</P>
      <P>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Negative, bossy meat creature! Daylight and everything.</P>
      <P>Oh right. I forgot about the battle. They're like sex, except I'm having them! You don't know how to do any of those. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</P>
      <P>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I don't want to be rescued. Fatal. Bite my shiny metal ass.</P>
      <P>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Is that a cooking show? We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</P>
      <P>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Really?! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</P>
      <P>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Kif might! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</P>
      <P>Belligerent and numerous. Soothe us with sweet lies. She also liked to shut up! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Ask her how her day was.</P>
      <P>You lived before you met me?! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Actually, that's still true. You don't know how to do any of those.</P>
      <P>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</P>
      <P>It doesn't look so shiny to me. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</P>
